F N a S - Five Nights as Szuj

Can you survive 6 hours in the midnight at Szuj? Yes? But what if 4 animatronics will do anything to stop you? Can you beat all the nights? Let's see...

Four animatronics:
- Freddy: He is sneaky and dangerous. He begins his path at camera04. Then moves down and can be found on camera02, and then on camera01. When he's at camera01, watch out, as he can move to your window quickly and jumpscare you. Close the window to send him back at his beginning position, or ignore it to get jumpscared.
- Bonny: He is fast and quiet. He moves when you don't look at him. Firstly appears at camera03, then goes down and can be found on camera01, then goes into your office through the window. When he's near your window, close it quickly and wait for him to go away. If you manage to close the window on time, he will start his path again, otherwise he will jumpscare you.
- Chica: Chica is very fast. She will appear in front of your door and can be visible only when you turn the doorlights on. She moves closer to you whenever you don't look at her. On the last phase, she will stand right behind your door; you have to close the door as soon as possible in order to send her back and prevent her jumpscare.
- Foxy: Foxy is so shy, so please, don't look at him. He appears on camera04, behind the door there. He will slowly open the door and eventually get out of his room and run after you. Luckily for you, you can look at him for a moment to stop him from moving, but it is better not to irritate him, and be careful, when he runs out, you have almost no time to close your door, or...
- Marionette: She likes music so much that she might get very furious if it ends. Don't make her angry by filling the music box on camera05 continuously. If the music ends, she will run to you. There is still a chance for you to survive, though. She loves flowers and we've found some for you. Whenever she's in your office, just raise the flowers, and she will peacefully go back and refill the box by herself. However, sometimes she will be stunned by the flowers for a couple of seconds, so it might disturb you, but, under no circumstances should you put the flowers off when she's looking at them
- Golden Freddy: He is misterious, yet not so fast. He can suddenly appear absolutely everywhere, even in your office, but it is very easy to confuse him by taking the camera on/off or simply switching to another camera. You have to be very quick, though, as despite his slowness, his jumpscares are fast enough.

Tips:
- When animatronic leaves you, your screen will blink for a moment, so you always stay informed
- When Freddy leaves camera01 and is near your window, you can prevent jumpscare by not looking at the camera and not lightning the window up, but whenever you do so, you have almost no time to react
- Be extra careful with Freddy, as he can jumpscare you even if you don't see him walking to your office, anytime you look on cameras, he can move

Easter eggs:
- Marionette may sometimes come even if the box is charged, since she likes your flowers so much
- When Freddy is stopped, your office may sometimes evaporate
